	"home": "<p> The <em>Arcipelago Ceresa</em> project aims to produce a digital edition of the unpublished, dispersed, and posthumous writings of the Swiss-Italian author Alice Ceresa (1923-2001), while developing new research on her work. </p> <p> Ceresa – multilingual, active in a transnational context, ahead of her time on certain themes of queer and gender debates, and always courageously experimental – left numerous unpublished texts in her archive. At the same time, her published works remain largely inaccessible and unknown to contemporary readers to this day. Conceived in close collaboration with the Data Science Lab (DSL) at the University of Bern and the Swiss Literary Archives (ASL), this digital edition will therefore make available to readers not only a rich selection of unpublished and dispersed writings, but also a revised and updated version of certain posthumous texts, along with contemporary radio readings. </p> <p> These editorial efforts will be accompanied by four research projects focusing on areas of Ceresa criticism which, while they remain little explored, are of great interest to the scholarly community: on the one hand, the author’s multilingualism and transnationalism, and on the other hand, the connection in her writing between the deconstruction of literary genres and that of gender roles. </p>",
