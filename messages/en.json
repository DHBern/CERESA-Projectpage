At the same time, her published works remain largely inaccessible and unknown to contemporary readers to this day. Conceived in close collaboration with the Data Science Lab (DSL) at the University of Bern and the Swiss Literary Archives (ASL), this digital edition will therefore make available to readers not only a rich selection of unpublished and dispersed writings, but also a revised and updated version of certain posthumous texts, along with contemporary radio readings. </p> <p> These editorial efforts will be accompanied by four research projects focusing on areas of Ceresa criticism which, while they remain little explored, are of great interest to the scholarly community: on the one hand, the author’s multilingualism and transnationalism, and on the other hand, the connection in her writing between the deconstruction of literary genres and that of gender roles. </p>",

	"project_description_text": "<p>\n\tThe <em>Arcipelago Ceresa</em> project aims to make accessible, recontextualize, and highlight the\n\tliterary legacy of the Swiss-Italian writer Alice Ceresa, whose literary work and intellectual\n\tactivity – despite attracting a renewed interest in recent years – remain largely unexplored. By\n\tproposing a multimedia digital edition of her unpublished, dispersed, and posthumous works, the\n\tproject recovers and brings together a significant portion of Ceresa’s corpus on a single\n\topen-access digital platform, thereby enabling the development of new research perspectives.\n\tWithin the framework of a heterogeneous body of work (including fiction, essays, theatre, and\n\tpoetry), the edition will offer an extensive selection of dispersed writings (such as her\n\tjournalistic production), unpublished texts (including substantial portions of a planned trilogy\n\tof novels repeatedly announced but never completed), and posthumous works (among them the\n\t<em> Piccolo dizionario dell’inuguaglianza femminile,</em> presented here in an expanded and\n\tenriched edition with previously unpublished entries and the original audio recordings broadcast\n\tby the Radio svizzera di lingua italiana in 1978). The multimedia component reflects the\n\tdistinctive configuration of Ceresa’s <em>oeuvre</em>, which was not confined to manuscript and\n\tprint culture but also extended to the radio transmission of her works. The project will therefore\n\tincorporate radio recordings of Ceresa’s texts (some unpublished), produced by RSI in the late\n\t1970s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe editorial work will be accompanied by four research initiatives organized around two broad\n\tthematic areas: multilingualism and transnationalism on the one hand, and gender and literary\n\tgenre on the other. The research group at the University of Bern will focus on reconstructing the\n\tauthor’s multilingual profile – shaped at the intersection of Italian, German, and French – and on\n\tanalyzing the impact of this linguistic identity on her creative practices. The study will also\n\texamine the transnational processes and dynamics connected to Ceresa’s activities, with particular\n\tattention to her work as a translator and her role as a cultural mediator.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe research group at the University of Zurich will expand upon existing research on\n\texperimentalism and feminism in Ceresa’s work, combining these lines of inquiry with an\n\texamination of her deconstruction of literary genres as an act of liberation from the constraints\n\tof binary sexuality and gender normativity. This investigation will draw on contemporary\n\tphilosophical perspectives on gender, decolonial theories, and the lesbian studies of the 1970s.\n</p>",

	"ceresa_text": "<p>\n\tAlice Ceresa (Basel, 25 January 1923 - Rome, 22 December 2001) spends her childhood between Basel\n\tand Bellinzona. At her father’s insistence, she pursues commercial studies, but starts to write\n\tout of personal passion, contributing to the daily newspaper «Il Dovere». In the early 1940s she\n\tmoves to Zurich, where she collaborates with magazines and newspapers such as «Die Weltwoche» and\n\t«Svizzera italiana». During this period, she meets Franco Fortini and Ignazio Silone, and\n\tbefriends the writer, pianist, and Jungian psychoanalyst Aline Valangin, who in those difficult\n\tyears is hosting many exiled intellectuals at her home in Comologno, Canton Ticino.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter periods in France and in French-speaking Switzerland, and through Silone’s mediation, Ceresa\n\tsettles in Rome in 1950. There, she publishes in magazines such as «Botteghe Oscure», and later\n\tbecomes involved with the Italian avant-garde, while always preserving a strong stylistic and\n\tconceptual independence. She is also active as a translator from German, often working with the\n\tpublisher Longanesi and introducing Italian readers to works by authors such as Elias Canetti and\n\tGerold Späth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCeresa makes her fiction debut in 1943 with the short story <em>Gli altri</em>, published in\n\t«Svizzera italiana». She rises to prominence in 1967 with the experimental novel\n\t<em>La figlia prodiga</em>\n\t(Einaudi), the first title in the “La ricerca letteraria” series and winner of the Viareggio Prize\n\tfor Opera prima that same year. In 1979 she publishes the short story <em>La morte del padre</em>\n\tin «Nuovi Argomenti», and in 1990 the novel Bambine (Einaudi), which wins the Schiller Prize and offers\n\tan acute and pungent portrayal of childhood and patriarchal structures. From the 1970s onwards, she\n\tworks on the <em>Piccolo dizionario dell’inuguaglianza femminile</em>, published posthumously\n\t(nottetempo 2007, 2020).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHer work, centred on the female condition and on the search for linguistic forms capable of\n\trepresenting it, combines formal rigour, irony, and ethical tension. Today, Alice Ceresa is\n\trecognised as a significant voice in twentieth-century feminist and experimental writing.\n\tTranslated into French and German during her lifetime, her major works have recently been\n\treissued, and her writing is met with renewed critical interest.\n</p>",
